                        <h2>Bulking</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Bulking is the process of deliberately increasing calorie intake to build muscle mass. This will give you gains in size and strength. It involves consuming a surplus of calories—more than the body burns in a day—combined with a structured strength training program. Bulking is important because it provides the necessary nutrients and energy to repair and grow muscle tissue after intense workouts. To bulk effectively, eat in a caloric surplus (around 10-20% above maintenance), prioritize protein intake (to support muscle repair), and ensure you’re lifting progressively heavier weights (progressive overload).</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">You will likely put on fat in this phase of the bulking-cutting cycle, but there is no need to worry as you will lose the excess fat in the cutting phase. If, however, you are uncomfortable with the amount of fat you are putting on, decrease your caloric surplus.</p>

                        <h2>Cutting</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Cutting is the phase after bulking (typically) where individuals focus on reducing body fat while maintaining as much muscle mass as possible. A cut helps you get leaner for aesthetic or performance goals. Cutting is important because it helps reveal the muscle definition built during bulking by shedding excess fat, improving body composition and overall physique. To cut effectively, you need to create a calorie deficit, meaning consuming fewer calories than your body needs to maintain weight. However, it’s essential to do this gradually and ensure you're still eating enough protein to preserve muscle. A proper cutting strategy involves focusing on high protein/low calorie foods, increasing cardiovascular exercise, and continuing strength training to maintain muscle mass while losing fat. Tracking progress and adjusting calorie intake based on results is key to achieving a lean physique without significantly compromising strength and muscle mass.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">Inevitably you will lose some strength and muscle mass in this phase of the bulking-cutting cycle.</p>

                        <h2>Supplements</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Supplements can greatly enhance weight training by providing the body with the nutrients and compounds needed to improve performance, support muscle growth, and speed up recovery. When combined with a well-structured training program and proper nutrition, supplements can help maximize the effectiveness of weight training and accelerate progress toward fitness goals.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0">Pay attention to dosage of supplements to avoid exceeding the upper limit of vitamins, minerals, and other compounds in the body. Be cautious when taking individual amino acids, as consuming too much of one may interfere with your body's ability to absorb other essential amino acids.</p>
